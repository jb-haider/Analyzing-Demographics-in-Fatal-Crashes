# Analyzing-Demographics-in-Fatal-Crashes
 The primary objective was to assess whether individuals involved in fatal crashes in particular communities were residents of those communities and to pinpoint ZIP codes with a high prevalence of high-risk drivers, especially in areas near the borders of Oregon and Idaho.

Project Details: 

Our project focused on the 'Washington Fatal Crash Files,' aiming to provide insights, predictions, and policy recommendations to the Washington Traffic Safety Commission (WTSC). The primary objective was to assess whether individuals involved in fatal crashes in particular communities were residents of those communities and to pinpoint ZIP codes with a high prevalence of high-risk drivers, especially in areas near the borders of Oregon and Idaho.

Our methodology involved exploratory data analysis to identify trends and patterns and logistic regression to predict crash fatality probabilities and evaluate the impact of individual variables on fatality odds. The analysis revealed a significant proportion of non-resident drivers involved in fatal crashes (28% residents vs. 72% non-residents) and disparities in crash types and behavioral factors between residents and non-residents. Several high-risk ZIP codes were also identified, along with specific population demographics associated with increased risk.

In summary, this analysis underscores the importance of understanding driver demographics and commuting patterns in specific communities where fatal crashes occur. The findings offer valuable insights for policymakers and program managers seeking to develop effective traffic safety initiatives and interventions, ultimately contributing to improved road safety in Washington.
